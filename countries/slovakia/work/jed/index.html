  <div class = "facts">You might be suprised that you see pretty much "normal" food. That is because all salty food doesn't have to taste mouth dryingly salty. Meat soaks up a lot of salt and when I say lot, I mean a LOT. 
    <br> You might be asking: "Why do you list amount of sodium and not salt? Are they the same?". Firstly they aren't, secondly it is becaus the sodium is the effective part that our bodies use. If you want to know how much salt is in there, just multiply it by 2.5.
    <br>Our bodies need a small amount of sodium(around 1500mg). We should consume less than 2300 mg of sodium per day. As you can clearly see all of these foods exceed the amount, some of them nearly threefold. You can read more about effects of having too much salt on the next page.
