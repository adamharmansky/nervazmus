    <h1>Salt consumption in Turkey</h1>

    <h3>Salt consumption estimates</h3>
    </p>
    <p>Turkey is one of the few countries that has conducted a nationally representative
      24-hour sodium urinary excretion study, which is considered the most reliable technique for
      estimating salt consumption. While average salt consumption in most countries of the WHO European
      Region is estimated to be 8ï¿½12 g/day, the first such survey in Turkey, SALTuk1 conducted in 2008,
      indicated that salt consumption was 18 g/day per adult inhabitant. The study was repeated in 2012,
      and the results pointed to a 16 per cent decrease to 15 g/day.</p>

    <h3>Government commitment</h3>
    <p>The Government programme includes the three major components recommended by WHO for reduction of salt intake:
      monitoring, major reformulation actions and awareness raising.
    <ul>
      <li> <b> Successful steps already taken in Turkey include: </b>
        <ol>
          <li> reduction of salt in bread and some processed foods like tomato pastes;
          <li> regulation against the sale of chips in school canteens since July 2011
          <li> labelling regulations for food product.
        </ol>
      <li> <b> Reduction of salt in cheese and olives is expected by the end of 2013 </b>
    </ul>
